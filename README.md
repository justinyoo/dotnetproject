Project: Hack Together - The Great .NET 8 Hack

Description:

Our project is a participant in the Hack Together: The Great .NET 8 Hack competition, where we have developed an innovative solution utilizing OpenAI for response generation and textToSpeech technology for text-to-speech conversion. This solution allows for responses in two languages - English and German, utilizing the Language Service server.

Key Features of the Project:

OpenAI for Response Generation: We have integrated OpenAI to create automatic responses to queries, providing a unique and contextually dependent experience for users.

textToSpeech Technology: To enhance interaction with users, we have employed textToSpeech to convert generated text into speech. This makes our solution more accessible and user-friendly.

Support for Two Languages: We expanded functionality by offering responses in two languages - English and German. This is achieved using the Language Service server, which facilitates translation and processing of queries in both languages.

Optimization Pipelines: To improve data processing and response handling, we have implemented efficient pipelines. This allows us to optimize system processes, enhancing overall performance.
