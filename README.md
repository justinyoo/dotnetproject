Project: My .NET 8 Hack

Description:

My project is a submission for the Hack Together: The Great .NET 8 Hack competition, where I have developed an innovative solution independently. This solution leverages OpenAI for response generation and utilizes textToSpeech technology for converting text to speech. It enables responses in two languages - English and German - by making use of the Language Service server.

Key Features of My Project:

OpenAI for Response Generation: I have seamlessly integrated OpenAI to generate automatic responses, ensuring a unique and contextually relevant experience for users.

textToSpeech Technology: To enhance user interaction, I implemented textToSpeech for converting generated text into speech, providing accessibility and user-friendly features.

Support for Two Languages: My project offers responses in both English and German, facilitated by the Language Service server, which handles translation and processing for both languages.

Optimization Pipelines: I have implemented efficient pipelines to enhance data processing and response handling, optimizing the overall performance of the system.
